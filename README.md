A simple python code for generating HD wallets of 7 cryptocurrecies by using pywallet (DOGE,LTC,BTC,BCH,BTG,ETH,DSH)
This code takes the symbol of cryptocurrency from user and it generates the hd wallet. For egxample at first it shows the name of 7 coins and user enter it's symbol like BTC and it will give the result to user , and asks for saving the information in a txt file.

Running the code:

then download this source code from the github and go to it's directory and run it as same as other python codes
for egxample , running the code in linux : python3 bmhdwallet.py
